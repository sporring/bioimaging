    "\n",
    "It is not assumed that the student can program and has any background in image processing. It is not a course in the python language, but some exposure to python is needed. The pedagogical plan is: Copy, modify, create. That is, first the student copies code, verify that it works, and reflects on the output. Secondly, some existing code is modified to suit new tasks. Finally, solutions to completely new problems are created by combining and modifying existing code, knowledge, and experiments. Some assignments have been added for the student to test his/her understanding of the material.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module uses 2 images: A green image mainly showing the location of cilia, and a red image showing the location of a protein of interest. The images were provided by Lotte B. Pedersen, University of Copenhagen, for details see Pedersen et al., \"Endocytic control of cellular signaling at the primary cilium\", Trends in biochemical sciences, 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall task will be to estimate the amount of protein near the cilia using image processing and Python. In this module, we will first look at how to combine the two images programmatically to visually inspect the relation between the cilia and the protein, and later we will make a program to more precisely estimate the amount of protein near the cilia."
